This repository uses JUnit 5 and gradle to test the **Calculator.jar**, which is created by using IntelliJ. The video tutorials of creating a Java Calculator are here:

[2. Writing Your Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQHU8P2tzG4)

[3. Testing using JUnit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jaVOGnH4jo)

The default jar file will fail all the tests. You need to upload your own **Caculator.jar** to pass all the tests!
